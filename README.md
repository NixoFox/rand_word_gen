# rand_word_gen

A simple Python script that prints out a number of words with/without adjectives.

* Choose number of generated words
* Choose whether words have adjective or not (by 1 or 0)

The `nouns.txt` and `adjectives.txt` files are not made by me, they are someone else's, I found it on github and it had a bash script. For some reason bash script was not working for me so I wrote a Python script. I'm sorry but I forgot where I got those files (but it didn't have a LICENSE so it's fine).

**NOTE**: In case you use Python script somehow that your current directory is not the same as the one that contains txt files, change value of `nouns` and `adjectives` variables to **absolute** directory to txt files (`nouns.txt and` and `adjectives.txt` respectively).
